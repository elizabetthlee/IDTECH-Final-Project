# IDTECH-Final-Project

#  This code recognizes brain tumors from the given data set of MRI images and categorizes them  into 4 different classes (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor)

# The commands run in the terminal are similar to the one used in the Retraining Image Classification Models module example, but some names are changed to correspond with the data.

#  The class numbers correspond to the following tumors:
# 1. Glioma
# 2. Meningioma
# 3. No tumor
# 4. Pituitary

# The dataset has parentheses in the image file names, so they should be renamed before running specific images.

#  This project could be modified to work with a data set that includes more types of brain tumors. Datasets of MRI scans are pretty limited online due to patient confidentiality. 

#  Due to a limited amount of time to train the model, it may not be perfectly accurate. However, further modifications will improve the program.
